things to do to end this

2. write the ``main loop'' for the human-robot communication problem, draw STM diagram,
   this includes drawing the current expression on screen
----> do this with a tkinter gui! you have bookmarked the relevant tutorials, it's super chill
X. generate 2 far away datasets in bright light conditions (modify data generation script)
----> 2nd order problem
X. generate ``false'' dataset - create bait images which don't contain any class, but look somewhat similar.
   also add non-bait datapoints with different backgrounds (give it your wallpaper folder lol)
----> 2nd order problem
X. curate entire current dataset, note what's lacking (write script for easy deletion, start from show dataset)
----> 25k images, not gonna happen bro
5. reinstall everything on virt and local, first virt, do training,
	then do inference on both (serve via lan, then tunnel with ssh)
8. write report
